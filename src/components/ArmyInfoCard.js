                <h2>About the Indian Army</h2>
                <p>
                    The Indian Army is the land-based branch and largest component of the Indian Armed Forces, with a long-standing legacy of bravery, dedication, and patriotism. The President of India serves as the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, while it is operationally commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who oversees its diverse operations. The Army's core mission is to maintain national security, defending India against external threats, and securing its borders.

                <p>
                    In addition to its primary mission, the Indian Army plays a vital role in humanitarian and disaster relief operations. When natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or cyclones strike, the Army is among the first to respond, conducting rescue operations and offering aid. It also assists in maintaining internal security, supporting the government in managing civil unrest and aiding local administrations when needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Structured into various corps and regiments, the Indian Army has specialized divisions, including infantry, artillery, armored units, and engineering services. This well-organized structure allows the Army to perform across diverse terrainsâ€”from the high altitudes of the Himalayas to desert and jungle environments. The Indian Army's professionalism and dedication have earned it deep respect, both nationally and globally.
